    <h5>Report</h5>
    <p>Iâ€™m a computer engineer enthusiast about Front-End technologies for more than two decades. I started
      developing websites in 1999 and I have a strong knowledge of the main programming languages. I deal with
      web development in all its aspects: database design, creation of responsive interfaces, web app, single-page
      applications, REST api, administration panels, performance optimization. I like to keep abreast of the latest
      technologies that relate to the web. I am very proactive with a great aptitude for problem solving.</p>
